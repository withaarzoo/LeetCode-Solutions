# Solution Explanation: Maximum XOR Queries

This repository contains a solution for solving the **Maximum XOR Queries** problem in multiple programming languages: C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. Each solution is broken down step-by-step for ease of understanding.

## Problem Summary

Given an array of numbers (`nums`) and a parameter `maximumBit`, we are to find the maximum XOR result for each query by choosing an integer `k` that maximizes the XOR between `k` and the cumulative XOR of all elements in `nums`. The `k` must be within a range defined by `maximumBit`.

## Steps to Solution

The approach is the same across all languages but adapted to the syntax of each language. Hereâ€™s a language-by-language breakdown of how each solution works.

### C++ Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - We start by defining `XORed`, an integer to store the cumulative XOR of all elements in `nums`.
   - We also define `max_k`, which is the maximum value achievable with `maximumBit` bits. This is calculated as `2^maximumBit - 1`.

2. **Compute Initial XOR**:
   - Using a loop, XOR all elements in `nums` together to get an initial cumulative XOR (`XORed`) of the entire array.

3. **Process Each Query in Reverse**:
   - We loop from the last element of `nums` to the first.
   - For each query, calculate `k` as `XORed ^ max_k`. This gives the integer `k` that maximizes the XOR.
   - Append `k` to our `answer` array.
   - Update `XORed` by removing the effect of the last element in `nums`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The final `answer` array contains the results for all queries, and we return it.

### Java Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Define `XORed` to store the cumulative XOR of all elements in `nums`.
   - Calculate `max_k` as `(1 << maximumBit) - 1` to get the maximum value achievable within `maximumBit` bits.

2. **Compute Initial XOR**:
   - Use a loop to XOR all elements in `nums`, updating `XORed` with each element.

3. **Reverse Loop for Queries**:
   - Loop backward from the last element of `nums`.
   - For each query, calculate `k` as `XORed ^ max_k`.
   - Store `k` in the `answer` array.
   - Update `XORed` by XORing it with the current element to "remove" its effect.

4. **Return the Final Answer**:
   - The `answer` array now contains all query results, which we return as our solution.

### JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Define `XORed` to store the cumulative XOR of all numbers in `nums`.
   - Calculate `max_k` as `(1 << maximumBit) - 1` to get the highest possible value within `maximumBit` bits.

2. **Compute Initial XOR**:
   - Loop over `nums` and calculate the cumulative XOR (`XORed`).

3. **Process Each Query in Reverse**:
   - Start from the last element of `nums` and work backwards.
   - For each query, calculate `k` as `XORed ^ max_k`.
   - Store `k` in the `answer` array.
   - Update `XORed` by removing the effect of the last element.

4. **Return the Final Array**:
   - Return `answer` as the array containing all query results.

### Python Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Define `XORed` to hold the cumulative XOR of all elements in `nums`.
   - Calculate `max_k` as `(1 << maximumBit) - 1` to get the largest value allowed by `maximumBit`.

2. **Compute Cumulative XOR**:
   - Loop through each number in `nums` to calculate the cumulative XOR.

3. **Process Each Query in Reverse**:
   - Start from the last element of `nums` and process each in reverse.
   - For each query, calculate `k` as `XORed ^ max_k` to get the maximum XOR.
   - Append `k` to the `answer` list.
   - Update `XORed` by XORing it with the last element in `nums`.

4. **Return Results**:
   - `answer` now holds the maximum XOR result for each query, which we return as the solution.

### Go Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Define `XORed` to keep the cumulative XOR of all elements in `nums`.
   - Calculate `max_k` as `(1 << maximumBit) - 1` to get the maximum possible integer with `maximumBit` bits.

2. **Compute Initial XOR**:
   - XOR all elements in `nums` to get the cumulative XOR.

3. **Process Each Query in Reverse**:
   - Start from the end of `nums` and move backwards.
   - For each query, calculate `k` as `XORed ^ max_k`.
   - Add `k` to the `answer` slice.
   - Update `XORed` by removing the effect of the last element.

4. **Return the Result Slice**:
   - Return `answer` as the final result, containing the XOR values for each query.
