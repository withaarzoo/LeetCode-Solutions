# Can Be Valid Parentheses with Locked Characters

This README provides a **step-by-step explanation** for solving the "Can Be Valid Parentheses with Locked Characters" problem in **C++**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Go**. Each explanation is designed to help you understand the solution logic without directly exposing the code. Follow along to break down the approach and reasoning for each language.

## ðŸš€ C++ Code

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Odd Length Check**:
   - First, check if the length of the string is odd. If so, return `false` immediately since an odd-length string can't be a valid parentheses sequence.

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - Start traversing the string from left to right.
   - Maintain two variables:
     - `open`: Keeps track of the net count of opening brackets.
     - `flexible`: Counts the number of characters that can be treated as either `(` or `)` because they are not locked.
   - Update `open` based on locked characters. Increase `flexible` for unlocked characters.
   - If at any point `open + flexible < 0`, it means too many `)` appear before enough `(`, so return `false`.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - Traverse the string from right to left.
   - Reuse `open` to count the net number of closing brackets (`)`).
   - Similarly, use `flexible` for unlocked characters.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `false`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If both passes succeed, return `true`.

## ðŸš€ Java Code

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Odd Length Check**:
   - Verify if the length of the string is odd. Return `false` if it is because a valid parentheses sequence must have an even number of characters.

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - Maintain:
     - `open`: Keeps track of the count of `(` brackets.
     - `flexible`: Tracks the number of unlocked characters.
   - Update `open` for locked characters (`locked = 1`), and increase `flexible` for unlocked ones.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `false` as too many `)` have appeared.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - Perform a reverse traversal of the string.
   - Use `open` to count closing brackets (`)`), and `flexible` for unlocked characters.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `false`.

4. **Return Final Result**:
   - If both passes succeed, return `true`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Odd Length Check**:
   - Check if the string's length is odd. If yes, return `false` since balancing is impossible.

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - Traverse the string from the beginning to the end.
   - Maintain:
     - `open`: Tracks the balance of opening brackets.
     - `flexible`: Tracks characters that are not locked.
   - Update the counts based on whether characters are locked or unlocked.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `false`.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - Reverse the traversal of the string.
   - Reuse `open` for closing brackets and `flexible` for unlocked characters.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `false`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If both checks pass, return `true`.

## ðŸš€ Python Code

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Odd Length Check**:
   - Start by checking if the string has an odd number of characters. If true, immediately return `False`.

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - Maintain two counters:
     - `open`: Tracks the net count of opening brackets.
     - `flexible`: Counts characters that are unlocked (`locked = '0'`).
   - Increment `open` for `(` and decrement it for `)` (locked characters). Increment `flexible` for unlocked characters.
   - If at any point `open + flexible < 0`, return `False`.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - Traverse the string in reverse.
   - Recalculate `open` for closing brackets (`)`).
   - Use `flexible` to handle unlocked characters.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `False`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If both passes validate the string, return `True`.

## ðŸš€ Go Code

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Odd Length Check**:
   - Check if the length of the string is odd. If it is, return `false` since balancing is impossible.

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - Start from the beginning and traverse to the end.
   - Keep two variables:
     - `open`: Tracks the net count of opening brackets.
     - `flexible`: Tracks the number of characters that can be either `(` or `)` based on their unlocked state.
   - Update `open` for locked characters and `flexible` for unlocked ones.
   - If `open + flexible < 0` at any point, return `false`.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - Traverse the string from the end to the beginning.
   - Use `open` for closing brackets and `flexible` for unlocked characters.
   - If `open + flexible < 0`, return `false`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - If both passes confirm the string is valid, return `true`.

### ðŸŒŸ Common Logic Across All Languages

- Perform **two traversals** (left-to-right and right-to-left) to validate the balance of parentheses while accommodating unlocked characters.
- Use simple counters (`open` and `flexible`) to dynamically manage the balance as you iterate.
- Return `true` only if both traversals succeed without imbalance.

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways

- This problem demonstrates the importance of **two-pass traversal** and dynamic updates based on constraints (locked vs. unlocked).
- While the syntax and structure differ slightly across languages, the core logic remains the same.
