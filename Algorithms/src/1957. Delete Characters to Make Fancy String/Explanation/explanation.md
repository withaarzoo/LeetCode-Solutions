# Fancy String Solution Guide

This README explains step-by-step how to solve the "Delete Characters to Make Fancy String" problem in various languages: C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. The goal is to ensure no three consecutive characters in the string are the same by deleting the minimum number of characters.

---

## Problem Understanding

We need to create a "fancy" string by removing characters so that no three consecutive characters are identical. To achieve this, we build a new result string by selectively adding characters from the input string while following the rule of avoiding three identical consecutive characters.

## Solution Breakdown (All Languages)

### Step 1: Initialize the Result Variable

- **Purpose**: Start with an empty container (string, list, or byte slice) to build the "fancy" string.
- **Example**: In Python, this would be an empty list; in JavaScript, an empty string; in Go, a byte slice.

### Step 2: Loop Through Each Character in the String

- **Purpose**: Traverse the entire input string character by character.
- **Implementation**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the characters in `s`.

### Step 3: Check the Last Two Characters in the Result

- **Purpose**: Ensure that adding the current character will not result in three consecutive identical characters.
- **Details**:
  - If there are fewer than two characters in the result, add the current character without checks.
  - If there are already two characters in the result, check if both are the same as the current character:
    - If they are the same, **skip** adding the current character.
    - If they are different, **add** the current character to the result.

### Step 4: Append Character to Result if Condition is Met

- **Purpose**: Conditionally add characters to avoid three consecutive identical characters.
- **Details**: This step is executed only if the condition in Step 3 allows it.

### Step 5: Return the Final Result

- **Purpose**: Return the result in the desired format.
- **Conversion**:
  - In Python, use `''.join(result)` to convert the list to a string.
  - In Go, convert the byte slice to a string before returning.
- **Result**: The final string is guaranteed to be a "fancy" string, with no three consecutive identical characters.

## Language-Specific Notes

### C++ Code Explanation

1. **Initialize an Empty String**: `string result;`
2. **Loop Through Each Character in `s`** using a `for` loop.
3. **Check the Last Two Characters in `result`** before adding the current character.
4. **Add or Skip** the character based on whether it maintains the "fancy" requirement.
5. **Return `result`** after the loop completes.

### Java Code Explanation

1. **Initialize a `StringBuilder`**: Use `StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();`.
2. **Loop Through Each Character in `s`** by converting `s` to a character array.
3. **Conditionally Add** the character if it maintains the "fancy" condition.
4. **Add Character to `StringBuilder`** or skip as needed.
5. **Return the Final Result**: Convert `StringBuilder` to a string with `result.toString()`.

### JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Initialize an Empty String**: `let result = "";`
2. **Loop Through Each Character in `s`** using a `for` loop.
3. **Conditionally Add Characters** to `result` by checking the last two characters.
4. **Skip or Add** the character based on the "fancy" condition.
5. **Return the Result String** after completing the loop.

### Python Code Explanation

1. **Initialize an Empty List**: `result = []` (lists allow easy appending).
2. **Loop Through Each Character in `s`** using a `for` loop.
3. **Conditionally Append** characters to `result` based on the last two items.
4. **Add Character or Skip** based on the "fancy" string condition.
5. **Join List to String**: Return `''.join(result)` for the final fancy string.

### Go Code Explanation

1. **Initialize a Byte Slice**: `result := []byte{}` for the final "fancy" string.
2. **Loop Through Each Character in `s`** with a `for` loop.
3. **Conditionally Append Characters** to `result` by checking the last two characters.
4. **Add or Skip Characters** to maintain the fancy requirement.
5. **Convert Byte Slice to String**: Return `string(result)` as the final result.
