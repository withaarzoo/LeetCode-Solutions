# Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets

## Problem Overview

You are given an integer array `nums`. The task is to find the maximum possible bitwise OR of any subset of `nums` and return the number of different non-empty subsets that achieve this maximum OR.

### Example

#### Example 1

- **Input**: `nums = [3,1]`
- **Output**: `2`
- **Explanation**: There are two subsets with the maximum bitwise OR of 3: `[3]` and `[3, 1]`.

#### Example 2

- **Input**: `nums = [2,2,2]`
- **Output**: `7`
- **Explanation**: All non-empty subsets have a bitwise OR of 2.

## Step-by-Step Explanation in Different Languages

### C++ Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - First, compute the maximum possible OR for the entire array. This is the OR of all elements combined.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - Define a recursive backtracking function that starts with an initial OR value of 0.
   - At each step, include the current element in the OR and check if the OR matches the maximum.

3. **Count Valid Subsets**:
   - If the OR equals the maximum OR, increment a global count that keeps track of how many subsets match the desired OR.

4. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - The function then recursively explores all possible subsets by either including or excluding each element.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Once all subsets are explored, return the total count of valid subsets.

### Java Code Explanation

1. **Initialize maxOR**:
   - Calculate the maximum OR by combining all elements in the array.

2. **Backtracking Helper Function**:
   - Define a recursive helper method that takes the current OR value, the current index in the array, and the number of subsets found so far.

3. **Increment Count**:
   - Whenever the current OR value matches the maximum OR, increment the count.

4. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Use a loop to recursively explore each possible subset by including or skipping the current element at each step.

5. **Final Count**:
   - After all subsets are generated, return the total count of subsets that achieved the maximum OR.

### JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Calculate Maximum OR**:
   - Compute the maximum OR value by OR-ing all elements in the array.

2. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore each subset. For each subset, calculate its OR value and check if it matches the maximum OR.

3. **Base Case and Increment**:
   - If the current subset’s OR value matches the maximum OR, increment a counter.

4. **Exploration of Subsets**:
   - Recursively include each element in the subset or skip it, thus generating all possible subsets.

5. **Result Return**:
   - After exploring all subsets, return the total number of subsets that achieve the maximum OR.

### Python Code Explanation

1. **Determine Maximum OR**:
   - Start by calculating the maximum OR for the entire array.

2. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - Define a recursive function to explore each subset, starting from an initial OR value of 0 and adding elements one by one.

3. **Check Subsets**:
   - For each subset, check if its OR equals the maximum OR and increment a counter if it does.

4. **Recursion**:
   - Recursively try all possible combinations of elements in the array, generating every possible subset.

5. **Return Count**:
   - After exploring all subsets, return the total number that match the maximum OR.

### Go Code Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Compute the maximum OR value by OR-ing all elements in the array.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking function that explores all subsets. For each subset, compute its OR value and check if it matches the maximum OR.

3. **Track Count**:
   - If a subset’s OR matches the maximum OR, increment a global count.

4. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - Recursively include or skip elements in the subset, thus generating every possible subset.

5. **Final Count**:
   - After exploring all possible subsets, return the total count of subsets that match the maximum OR.
