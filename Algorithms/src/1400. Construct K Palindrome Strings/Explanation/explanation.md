# Problem: Can Construct K Palindromes

This document explains step-by-step how the solution is implemented in various programming languages (C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Go) to determine whether it is possible to construct `k` palindrome strings using all the characters of a given string `s`.

---

## General Steps  

Each implementation follows these steps:  

1. **Initial Check**:  
   - If `k` (the number of palindromes to construct) is greater than the length of the string `s`, it is impossible to construct the palindromes. Return `false`.  

2. **Count Character Frequencies**:  
   - Use a frequency array (or hashmap) to count how many times each character appears in the string.  

3. **Count Odd Frequencies**:  
   - Palindromes allow at most one character to have an odd frequency. Traverse the frequency array and count the characters that appear an odd number of times.  

4. **Decision**:  
   - If the number of odd frequencies is less than or equal to `k`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### **C++ Implementation Explanation**  

1. **Initial Check**:  
   - Verify if `k > s.length()`. If true, return `false`.  
2. **Create Frequency Array**:  
   - Use a `vector<int>` of size 26 to count the occurrences of each character in the string.  
3. **Iterate Through the String**:  
   - For every character in `s`, increment its corresponding frequency in the array.  
4. **Count Odd Frequencies**:  
   - Traverse the frequency array and count how many values are odd.  
5. **Return Result**:  
   - Check if the number of odd frequencies is less than or equal to `k`. Return `true` or `false` accordingly.

### **Java Implementation Explanation**  

1. **Initial Check**:  
   - If `k > s.length()`, return `false` because more palindromes than characters cannot be created.  
2. **Create Frequency Array**:  
   - Use an `int[]` array of size 26 to store character frequencies.  
3. **Iterate Through the String**:  
   - Convert the string into a character array and update the frequency for each character in the array.  
4. **Count Odd Frequencies**:  
   - Traverse the frequency array and count characters that have odd occurrences.  
5. **Return Result**:  
   - If the number of odd frequencies is less than or equal to `k`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### **JavaScript Implementation Explanation**  

1. **Initial Check**:  
   - If `k > s.length`, return `false` because we cannot have more palindromes than the total number of characters in the string.  
2. **Create Frequency Array**:  
   - Use an array of size 26 initialized with zeros to count the occurrences of each character in the string.  
3. **Iterate Through the String**:  
   - For each character in the string, calculate its ASCII code, map it to the array index, and increment the corresponding frequency.  
4. **Count Odd Frequencies**:  
   - Traverse the frequency array and count the number of characters with odd occurrences.  
5. **Return Result**:  
   - Compare the odd frequency count with `k`. Return `true` if the count is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise return `false`.

### **Python Implementation Explanation**  

1. **Initial Check**:  
   - If `k > len(s)`, return `False`. This ensures the number of palindromes does not exceed the total number of characters.  
2. **Create Frequency Array**:  
   - Use a list of size 26 initialized with zeros to count the occurrences of each character.  
3. **Iterate Through the String**:  
   - Convert each character to its corresponding index (using `ord(char) - ord('a')`) and increment its frequency in the list.  
4. **Count Odd Frequencies**:  
   - Use a generator expression to count the number of characters with odd frequencies in the list.  
5. **Return Result**:  
   - If the odd frequency count is less than or equal to `k`, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### **Go Implementation Explanation**  

1. **Initial Check**:  
   - If `k > len(s)`, return `false` because constructing more palindromes than available characters is impossible.  
2. **Create Frequency Array**:  
   - Use a slice of size 26 initialized with zeros to store the frequencies of each character in the string.  
3. **Iterate Through the String**:  
   - Convert each character to its corresponding index (`char - 'a'`) and increment the frequency at that index.  
4. **Count Odd Frequencies**:  
   - Iterate through the frequency slice and count how many characters have odd frequencies.  
5. **Return Result**:  
   - Return `true` if the odd frequency count is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise return `false`.

### Key Notes  

- All implementations share the same logic but are adapted to each languageâ€™s syntax and features.  
- The key is understanding the connection between character frequencies and palindrome formation.
