# Longest Path in Grid with Increasing Moves

This README provides a step-by-step explanation for solving the problem of finding the longest increasing path in a grid using multiple programming languages. We start with the problem's approach and then dive into a language-specific breakdown.

## Problem Description
Given a 2D grid, each cell contains an integer. You are allowed to start from any cell in the first column and can move to the right, up-right, or down-right, but only to cells with a strictly greater value. The goal is to determine the maximum number of moves that can be made.

## Approach
The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently find the longest path by storing intermediate results and building upon them.

### Steps in the Approach
1. **Initialize a DP Table**: 
   - Create a `dp` table where `dp[row][col]` will hold the maximum number of moves possible starting from `grid[row][col]`.

2. **Backwards Processing**:
   - Start filling the `dp` table from the last column and move leftward to ensure that each cell's result relies on already-calculated values to the right.
   
3. **Transition Check**:
   - For each cell, calculate potential moves:
     - Move directly right.
     - Move up-right.
     - Move down-right.
   - Check if the destination cell has a strictly greater value and update the `dp` table accordingly.

4. **Extract Result**:
   - The final answer is the maximum value in the first column, representing the longest path from any cell in the first column.

## Language-Specific Breakdown

Each language follows a similar logic but is tailored to the syntax and nuances of the respective language.

### C++ Code Explanation

1. **Set up the DP Table**:
   - Initialize a 2D vector, `dp`, to store results for each cell.

2. **Loop Backward from Last Column**:
   - Use a loop to process each column from right to left.

3. **Check Possible Moves**:
   - For each cell, check moves to:
     - Right cell (same row).
     - Up-right cell (previous row).
     - Down-right cell (next row).
   - Update `dp[row][col]` with the maximum moves possible from each option.

4. **Find Maximum Moves**:
   - After filling the DP table, loop through the first column to find the maximum number of moves starting from any cell.

### Java Code Explanation

1. **Initialize DP Array**:
   - Create a 2D integer array `dp` to store the longest increasing path lengths for each cell.

2. **Iterate Backwards Through Columns**:
   - Process each column from the second last to the first, allowing each cell to refer to values in the following column.

3. **Calculate Valid Moves**:
   - For each cell:
     - Check possible moves to the right, up-right, and down-right.
     - Only move if the destination cell has a greater value.
   - Update the `dp` table with the maximum moves from each possible move.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The answer is the maximum value in the first column after processing all cells.

### JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Create DP Array**:
   - Use a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum moves for each cell.

2. **Process Each Column Backwards**:
   - Loop from the second last column back to the first, calculating possible moves for each cell.

3. **Evaluate Moves**:
   - For each cell, calculate moves to:
     - Right, up-right, and down-right cells.
   - Only consider moves to cells with greater values and update `dp` with the maximum path found.

4. **Get Final Result**:
   - Find the highest value in the first column of `dp`, representing the maximum moves starting from any cell in that column.

### Python Code Explanation

1. **Set Up DP Table**:
   - Initialize a 2D list `dp` to hold the maximum moves possible from each cell.

2. **Backward Processing Through Columns**:
   - Starting from the last column and moving leftward, compute possible moves for each cell.

3. **Check Valid Moves**:
   - For each cell, check moves to:
     - Right, up-right, and down-right cells.
   - If the destination cell has a greater value, update `dp` with the maximum moves possible from that path.

4. **Extract Maximum Moves**:
   - The result is the maximum value in the first column, representing the longest path possible starting from any cell in that column.

### Go Code Explanation

1. **Initialize DP Table**:
   - Create a 2D slice `dp` to store the longest paths for each cell.

2. **Backwards Processing**:
   - Process each column from right to left, calculating the longest path for each cell.

3. **Calculate Valid Moves**:
   - For each cell:
     - Check moves to the right, up-right, and down-right cells.
   - Only update if the destination cell is greater and yields a longer path.

4. **Retrieve Result**:
   - Find the maximum value in the first column to determine the longest possible path.
