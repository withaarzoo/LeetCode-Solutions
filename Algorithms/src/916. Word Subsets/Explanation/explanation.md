# Word Subsets Solution Explanation

## Problem Description

We are given two arrays of words: `words1` and `words2`. Our goal is to find all words in `words1` that are "universal" to all the words in `words2`. A word in `words1` is considered universal if it contains all the letters and their frequencies of every word in `words2`.

---

## Intuition

The challenge is to efficiently check if words in `words1` contain the cumulative character requirements of all words in `words2`. Here's how we break it down:

1. **Combine Requirements from `words2`**: Merge the character requirements of all words in `words2` into a single frequency map. For example, if `words2 = ["abc", "ab"]`, the combined requirement is `{a: 1, b: 1, c: 1}`.
2. **Validate Words in `words1`**: For each word in `words1`, check if it satisfies the combined requirements.

## Approach

The solution involves two main steps:

### Step 1: Build a Global Character Requirement

- Iterate through all words in `words2`.
- For each word, calculate its character frequencies.
- Maintain a global frequency map where the frequency of each character is the **maximum** frequency across all words in `words2`.

### Step 2: Validate Words in `words1`

- For each word in `words1`, calculate its character frequencies.
- Check if the word meets or exceeds the global requirements from `words2`.
- If the word meets the requirements, add it to the result list.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Building the global requirement: $$O(n_2 \cdot m_2)$$, where \(n_2\) is the number of words in `words2`, and \(m_2\) is the average length of words in `words2`.  
  - Validating words: $$O(n_1 \cdot m_1)$$, where \(n_1\) is the number of words in `words1`, and \(m_1\) is the average length of words in `words1`.
  - Overall: $$O(n_1 \cdot m_1 + n_2 \cdot m_2)$$.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(26) = O(1)$$ for character frequency arrays.

## Step-by-Step Explanation for Each Language

### C++ Code

1. **Global Frequency Calculation**:
   - Use a vector of size 26 to store the maximum frequency of each character in `words2`.
   - Iterate through `words2`, updating the global frequency map as needed.
2. **Validation of Words**:
   - For each word in `words1`, calculate its character frequencies.
   - Compare the frequencies with the global requirement from `words2`.
3. **Final Result**:
   - If a word satisfies all character requirements, include it in the result list.

### Java Code

1. **Global Frequency Calculation**:
   - Use an integer array of size 26 for the maximum frequency of each character in `words2`.
   - Traverse through each word in `words2`, updating the array to reflect the highest frequency of each character.
2. **Validation of Words**:
   - For every word in `words1`, compute its character frequencies.
   - Match these frequencies against the global frequency array.
3. **Final Result**:
   - If all conditions are met, add the word to the output list.

### JavaScript Code

1. **Global Frequency Calculation**:
   - Use an array of size 26 to track the maximum frequency of characters in `words2`.
   - Loop through `words2`, calculating frequencies and updating the global array as necessary.
2. **Validation of Words**:
   - For each word in `words1`, calculate its character counts.
   - Compare these counts with the global requirements from `words2`.
3. **Final Result**:
   - Add words that meet the requirements to the result array.

### Python Code

1. **Global Frequency Calculation**:
   - Utilize a list of size 26 to store the maximum frequency for each character.
   - Iterate over `words2`, computing character frequencies for each word and updating the global list.
2. **Validation of Words**:
   - For every word in `words1`, compute its character frequencies using a helper function.
   - Compare the frequencies against the global frequency list.
3. **Final Result**:
   - Add valid words to the output list.

### Go Code

1. **Global Frequency Calculation**:
   - Use a fixed-size array of integers (size 26) for the maximum character frequencies from `words2`.
   - Process each word in `words2`, updating the array to capture the maximum frequencies.
2. **Validation of Words**:
   - For each word in `words1`, compute character frequencies using a helper function.
   - Validate these frequencies against the global requirement array.
3. **Final Result**:
   - Append words that satisfy the global character requirements to the result slice.

## Example

### Input

```plaintext
words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
words2 = ["e", "o"]
```

### Output

```plaintext
["facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
```

### Additional Notes

- Each language implementation uses **character frequency arrays** to optimize the solution, ensuring efficient comparison of character counts.
- This approach minimizes unnecessary recomputation and ensures a clean, modular design across all implementations.
