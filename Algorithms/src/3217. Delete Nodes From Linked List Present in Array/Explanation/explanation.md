## Problem Summary

You are given an array of integers `nums` and the head of a singly linked list `head`. Remove all nodes from the linked list whose value appears in `nums`, and return the head of the modified linked list.

In short: delete every node from the linked list that has a value present in `nums`.

---

## Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
* All elements in `nums` are unique.
* The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
* The input guarantees there is at least one node in the linked list whose value is **not** present in `nums`.

---

## Intuition

I thought about how to check quickly whether a node's value needs to be deleted. Checking membership in `nums` repeatedly would be slow if done with linear search. So I convert `nums` into a hash set for constant-time membership checks.
Then I saw that deleting nodes in a singly linked list is easiest when I keep a `prev` pointer that can re-link around `curr` if `curr` must be removed. To handle the case where the head needs deletion, I create a `dummy` node pointing to head â€” this avoids special-case code for head deletions.

---

## Approach

1. Convert `nums` into a hash set `toDelete` for O(1) lookups.
2. Create a `dummy` node with `dummy.next = head`. Initialize two pointers: `prev = dummy`, `curr = head`.
3. Iterate through the list with `curr`:

   * If `curr.val` is in `toDelete`, remove `curr` by `prev.next = curr.next` (do not advance `prev`).
   * Otherwise, keep `curr` and set `prev = curr`.
   * Move `curr = curr.next` after each step.
4. Return `dummy.next` which is the (possibly new) head.

---

## Data Structures Used

* **Hash set** (`unordered_set` / `HashSet` / `Set` / `map`-based set in Go): for O(1) membership checking of values that should be removed.
* **Singly linked list pointers** (`dummy`, `prev`, `curr`): to traverse and perform deletions without special-case head handling.

---

## Operations & Behavior Summary

* Convert `nums` -> set: `O(m)` time & `O(m)` space (m = `nums.length`).
* Single pass over linked list: `O(n)` time (n = number of nodes).
* Deletion is performed by relinking `prev.next` to `curr.next` whenever `curr` is to be removed.
* `prev` advances only when current node is kept; this allows skipping multiple consecutive removable nodes.

---

## Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`

  * `n` = number of nodes in the linked list.
  * `m` = `nums.length` (to build the set).
* **Space Complexity:** `O(m)` for the hash set. Apart from that we use `O(1)` extra pointers (`dummy`, `prev`, `curr`).

## Step-by-step Detailed Explanation (C++, Java, JavaScript, Python3, Go)

I'll explain the algorithm (these steps map to every language's implementation):

1. **Build a set of values to delete**

   * C++: `unordered_set<int> toDelete(nums.begin(), nums.end());`
   * Java: `Set<Integer> toDelete = new HashSet<>(); for (int x : nums) toDelete.add(x);`
   * JavaScript: `const toDelete = new Set(nums);`
   * Python: `to_delete = set(nums)`
   * Go: `toDelete := make(map[int]struct{}, len(nums)); for _, v := range nums { toDelete[v] = struct{}{} }`
     *Why:* membership tests become O(1).

2. **Create a dummy node**

   * Purpose: makes deletion of the head node simple.
   * All languages: `dummy` node points to `head`. `prev = dummy`, `curr = head`.

3. **Traverse the linked list with two pointers**

   * Loop: `while curr != null` / `while (curr)` etc.
   * If `curr.val` is in the set:

     * Do `prev.next = curr.next` (skip `curr`, effectively deleting it).
     * Do **not** advance `prev`. Keeping `prev` unmoved lets us delete multiple consecutive nodes because `prev` still refers to the last kept node.
   * Else (value is not in set):

     * Move `prev = curr` (we keep the node).
   * Always advance `curr = curr.next` to continue scanning.

4. **Return `dummy.next`**

   * This is the head of the modified list (handles the original head being deleted or not).

### Why `prev` doesn't move on deletion?

If we delete the `curr`, `prev` must still point to the last kept node so that subsequent deletions can be linked around. Consider a stretch of deletable nodes: we need `prev` to link across the whole deletable block to the next kept node.

## Examples

**Example 1**

* Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`, `head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
* Output: `4 -> 5`
* Explanation: Remove nodes with values 1, 2 and 3.

**Example 2**

* Input: `nums = [1]`, `head = 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2`
* Output: `2 -> 2 -> 2`
* Explanation: Remove nodes with value 1.

**Example 3**

* Input: `nums = [5]`, `head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`
* Output: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`
* Explanation: No node has value 5.

## How to use / Run locally

### C++

1. Create a `main.cpp` where you build a sample list and call `Solution().modifiedList(nums, head)`.
2. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o run && ./run
   ```

### Java

1. Place `Solution` and `ListNode` definitions in a `.java` file.
2. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   javac Solution.java
   java Solution
   ```

### JavaScript (Node)

1. Save the JS code in a file `solution.js` and add a simple test harness that builds `ListNode`s and prints result.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   node solution.js
   ```

### Python3

1. Create a Python script `solution.py` with `ListNode` and `Solution`.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python3 solution.py
   ```

### Go

1. Add the `modifiedList` function into a `main.go` with a test harness.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

*(The exact test harness is left to you â€” typical steps: build linked list nodes, call function, traverse and print the result.)*

## Notes & Optimizations

* Using a hash set is optimal for membership checks, giving O(1) per check. Because `nums` values are unique, building the set is straightforward.
* The algorithm performs one pass over the linked list, which is optimal â€” every node must be inspected at least once to decide whether to remove it.
* Memory use is dominated by the hash set `O(m)`. If `nums` is very large and memory is constrained, alternative approaches (like sorting `nums` and using binary search) trade memory for `O(m log m)` preprocessing and are usually slower. Given constraints, the hash-set approach is most practical.
* The dummy-node trick simplifies code and avoids head-special-case logic; this is a standard idiom for linked-list manipulation.
