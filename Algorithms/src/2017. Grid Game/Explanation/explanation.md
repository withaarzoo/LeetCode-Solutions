# Grid Game Solution: Step-by-Step Explanation

This repository contains solutions for the **Grid Game** problem implemented in five different programming languages: **C++**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Go**. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the approach taken for each language without revealing the code itself.

## Problem Overview

The problem involves a grid with two rows. The goal is to minimize the maximum sum collected by the second player while moving from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. Both players can only move right or down, and their paths cannot overlap.

## Explanation of Solutions

### **1. C++ Code**

#### Steps

1. **Understanding the Grid Setup**: Analyze the sum of elements above (top row) and below (bottom row) for every column.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Sums**: Utilize prefix sums to track the total sum collected by Player 1 and suffix sums to estimate Player 2's potential moves.
3. **Minimizing Player 2's Maximum**: For each column split, calculate Player 2's maximum score if Player 1 transitions to the bottom row.
4. **Final Decision**: Select the column where Player 2's maximum score is minimized.

### **2. Java Code**

#### Steps

1. **Grid Analysis**: Start by splitting the grid into top and bottom rows.
2. **Tracking Scores**: Use two cumulative arrays to track sums for both rows:
   - Prefix sums for the top row.
   - Suffix sums for the bottom row.
3. **Simulating Player Transitions**: For each column, simulate the scenario where Player 1 moves to the bottom row and compute Player 2's possible scores.
4. **Optimization**: Return the minimum score among all possible transitions.

### **3. JavaScript Code**

#### Steps

1. **Initial Setup**: Parse the 2D grid array and calculate cumulative sums for both rows.
2. **Precomputing Scores**:
   - Compute the prefix sum for the first row (top).
   - Compute the suffix sum for the second row (bottom).
3. **Iterative Comparison**: Iterate over every column and calculate the maximum score Player 2 can achieve for that column split.
4. **Result**: Return the minimum of these maximum scores.

### **4. Python Code**

#### Steps

1. **Grid Representation**: Treat the input as a list of two subarrays representing the rows of the grid.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Computation**:
   - Calculate cumulative sums from left to right for the top row.
   - Calculate cumulative sums from right to left for the bottom row.
3. **Simulate Player Movement**: For each column, evaluate the impact of Player 1 moving down to the bottom row and Player 2's subsequent score.
4. **Optimal Path Selection**: Choose the column that minimizes Player 2's maximum score.

### **5. Go Code**

#### Steps

1. **Grid Input Handling**: Read the grid as a slice of slices representing the two rows.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Sums**:
   - Use arrays to calculate prefix sums for the top row.
   - Use arrays to calculate suffix sums for the bottom row.
3. **Iterate and Optimize**: Loop through each column and calculate the worst-case score for Player 2 if Player 1 transitions at that column.
4. **Determine the Result**: Return the column split that yields the least maximum score for Player 2.

## Key Concepts in All Solutions

1. **Prefix and Suffix Sums**:
   - Prefix sums are used to keep track of Player 1's potential scores.
   - Suffix sums are used to simulate Player 2's possible scores.

2. **Iterative Simulation**:
   - For every column, calculate the maximum score Player 2 can achieve.
   - The goal is to minimize this maximum score.

3. **Optimization**:
   - The solutions aim to efficiently compute results by avoiding overlapping paths and reducing unnecessary calculations.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- All solutions run in **O(n)**, where \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we only compute prefix and suffix sums once and iterate over the columns linearly.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(n)** for maintaining prefix and suffix arrays.
